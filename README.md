ECE Mastery Challenge for C#

A program that takes in two command line arguments and interprets the first as the real component of a phasor and the second
as the imaginary component. It then creates that phasor and adds a test phasor to it, then creates a 3x3 matrix with that result
and inverts the matrix.
